Hey there! I'm an undergraduate mathematics student. Storytelling with data has always been shiny and captivating to me as it marries mathematics and design, so I'm incredibly excited to be spending my senior year diving into data science and statistics via my coursework and Dr. D'Agostino McGowan's lab! I spent last fall learning lots of math (especially probability and combinatorics) in Budapest, and then I spent the spring interning at an education technology startup that surfaces data insights to teachers. I'm thrilled to continue learning and building my skills as a part of DMDS Lab!
